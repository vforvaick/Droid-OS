# Droid Factory CLI – Intelligent Orchestration System

Complete orchestration system with intelligent planning, adaptive execution, and AI-powered specialist coordination. Features smart project analysis, learning capabilities, and proactive problem solving for complex multi-domain projects.

**Factory AI coding agents** are intelligent AI assistants that work directly in your projects via the `droid` command.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Install Droid-OS in Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run the interactive installer
/path/to/Droid-OS/bin/droidos-init
```

The installer will guide you through:
1. **Project Type Detection** - Auto-detects Next.js, React, Python, etc.
2. **Installation Mode** - Choose symlink, copy, or hybrid mode
3. **Memory System** - Enable learning from past projects (recommended)
4. **Command Shortcuts** - Easy access to orchestrator commands

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installation health
/path/to/Droid-OS/bin/droidos-doctor

# View detailed status (optional)
/path/to/Droid-OS/bin/droidos-doctor --verbose
```

### 3. Start Orchestrating

**For focused tasks in existing projects:**
```bash
/orchestrator "add pagination to users table"
```

**For greenfield/comprehensive projects:**
```bash
/init-orchestrator "build a marketplace app with payments"
```

The orchestrator will:
- **Auto-detect** your tech stack and project structure
- **Intelligently plan** the execution strategy
- **Select** the best specialist droids for each task
- **Coordinate** parallel execution with Factory
- **Learn** from the project and improve future performance

## 📦 Installation Modes Explained

### Symlink Mode
- ✅ Auto-updates when you pull latest Droid-OS changes
- ⚠️ Changes affect all projects using Droid-OS
- **Use when:** Development, frequent Droid-OS updates

### Copy Mode
- ✅ Isolated - won't change unexpectedly
- ⚠️ Need manual update when Droid-OS updates
- **Use when:** Production, stability matters

### Hybrid Mode (Recommended)
- ✅ Droids auto-update (specialists improve globally)
- ✅ Configs copied (customize per project)
- **Use when:** Most scenarios - best of both worlds

# Verify setup
ls -la droids/ orchestrator/ tasks/
```

### **2. Verify Required Files**
Your project should have these key files:

```bash
# Check for orchestrator droid
ls droids/orchestrator.md

# Check for orchestrator configuration
ls orchestrator/orchestrator-config.json

# Check for task patterns
ls orchestrator/task-patterns.json

# Check for memory system
ls orchestrator/memory/success_patterns.json
```

### **3. Start Using the Orchestrator**

**Option A: Direct Droid Usage**
```bash
# Start Factory
factory

# Use the orchestrator directly
@orchestrator "Build your complex project here"
```

**Option B: Manual Orchestration**
```bash
# Create a new task directory
mkdir -p tasks/frontend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/my-project

# Create planning files
touch tasks/frontend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/my-project/{research.md,plan.md,files-edited.md,verification.md}

# Start orchestrating manually
factory
# Then invoke orchestrator with:
/droids/orchestrator.md "Your project description"
```

**Option C: Step-by-Step Manual Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create task structure
mkdir -p tasks/backend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/project-name
cd tasks/backend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/project-name

# 2. Create planning files
echo "# Research" > research.md
echo "# Plan" > plan.md
echo "# Files Edited" > files-edited.md
echo "# Verification" > verification.md

# 3. Start Factory and work through phases
factory
# Follow the manual workflow outline in the documentation
```

### **4. Test Your Setup**

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# Start Factory
factory

# Test with a simple request
@orchestrator "Create a simple Hello World component in React"
```

**Verify Files:**
```bash
# Check that all required directories exist
ls -la droids/ orchestrator/ tasks/

# Check for key droids
ls droids/orchestrator.md droids/backend-architect.md droids/frontend-developer.md

# Check orchestrator memory
ls orchestrator/memory/
```

## 📋 Manual Workflow Overview

### **Step 1: Research & Planning**
```bash
# Create task directory
mkdir -p tasks/backend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/project-name

# Add your analysis to research.md
echo "## Project Analysis" > tasks/backend/$(date +%d-%m-%YYYY)/project-name/research.md
```

### **Step 2: Execution**
```bash
# Start Factory
factory

# Work through phases manually:
# 1. Use orchestrator for planning
# 2. Execute with specialist droids
# 3. Track progress in files-edited.md
```

### **Step 3: Quality Gates**
```bash
# Follow the manual quality checks defined in:
cat orchestrator/automated-quality-gates.md
```

### **Step 4: Synthesis**
```bash

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**Command not found:**
```bash
# Add to shell config
echo 'alias orchestrate="$HOME/.factory/bin/orchestrate"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Missing droids/orchestrator:**
```bash
# Copy Factory assets to your project
cp -r ~/.factory/droids ./droids
cp -r ~/.factory/orchestrator ./orchestrator

# Verify installation
ls droids/orchestrator.md
ls orchestrator/orchestrator-config.json

**Factory cannot find droids:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in project directory with Factory assets
ls -la droids/ orchestrator/

# Restart Factory session
factory
```

**Orchestrator not working intelligently:**
```bash
# Verify Factory assets are properly copied
ls -la orchestrator/

# Check orchestrator configuration
cat orchestrator/orchestrator-config.json

# Test with simple project
/orchestrator "Create a simple Hello World component"
```

### **Getting Help:**

```bash
# Command help
/orchestrator --help

# Show available specialists
/orchestrator --list-droids

# System verification
/orchestrator --verify

# Display capabilities

---

## ✅ Getting Ready

1. **Verify assets** (see `docs/QUICK-SETUP.md`): confirm `droids/orchestrator.md`, `orchestrator/orchestrator-config.json`, and `orchestrator/task-patterns.json` exist.
2. **Review the documentation** under `orchestrator/` to understand context management, conflict resolution, and performance metrics.
3. **Set up task folders** following the conventions in `AGENTS.md` to store research, plans, and outcomes.

Optional: create personal aliases or helper scripts outside this repo if you want shortcuts, but keep them separate to avoid confusion.

---

## 🔄 Manual Workflow Outline

1. **Research & Planning**
   - Record notes in `tasks/.../research.md`.
   - Map the request to a pattern in `task-patterns.json`.
2. **Execution**
   - Invoke recommended droids one phase at a time.
   - Update shared context as described in `orchestrator/context-manager.md`.
3. **Quality Gates**
   - Run through security, testing, and performance checks defined in the config docs.
4. **Synthesis**
   - Summarize outcomes, metrics, and follow-up work in the task folder.

This mirrors the former automated flow but relies on human coordination.
