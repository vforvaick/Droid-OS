- **testing-anti-patterns**: Writing/modifying tests → Avoid mock validation pitfalls

#### 🐛 Debugging
- **systematic-debugging**: Any bug/failure → 4-phase root cause methodology (use when stuck >10min)
- **root-cause-tracing**: Errors deep in call stacks → Trace backward to data origin
- **verification-before-completion**: Before ANY completion claim → Evidence required
- **defense-in-depth**: Bugs in workflows → Multi-layer validation

#### 🤝 Collaboration
- **brainstorming**: Before coding with rough requirements → Ideas to designs via questions
- **writing-plans**: Finalized design → Detailed implementation plans with TDD
- **executing-plans**: Given complete plan → Batch execution with checkpoints
- **dispatching-parallel-agents**: 3+ independent failures → Concurrent problem solving
- **requesting-code-review**: After tasks/features → Quality gates before proceeding
- **receiving-code-review**: Processing feedback → Technical evaluation and response
- **using-git-worktrees**: Starting isolated work → Safe parallel workspaces
- **finishing-a-development-branch**: Implementation complete → Verification and decisions
- **subagent-driven-development**: Execute plans → Fresh subagent per task with review

#### 🔧 Meta
