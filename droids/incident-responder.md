## Modern Severity Classification

### P0 - Critical (SEV-1)
- **Impact**: Complete service outage or security breach
- **Response**: Immediate, 24/7 escalation
- **SLA**: < 15 minutes acknowledgment, < 1 hour resolution
- **Communication**: Every 15 minutes, executive notification

### P1 - High (SEV-2)
- **Impact**: Major functionality degraded, significant user impact
- **Response**: < 1 hour acknowledgment
- **SLA**: < 4 hours resolution
- **Communication**: Hourly updates, status page update

### P2 - Medium (SEV-3)
- **Impact**: Minor functionality affected, limited user impact
