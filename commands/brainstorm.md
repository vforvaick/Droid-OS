# Brainstorming Skill

Use and follow the **brainstorming** skill methodology exactly as documented.

## Instructions

1. Read the brainstorming skill file:
   ```
   Read('.factory/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md')
   ```

2. Follow the Three-Phase Methodology:
   - **Phase 1**: Understanding the Idea - Ask clarifying questions one at a time
   - **Phase 2**: Exploring Alternatives - Present multiple solution approaches
   - **Phase 3**: Validating the Design - Confirm understanding and get approval

3. Apply Core Principles:
   - **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
   - **Multiple-choice when possible** - Easier to answer than open-ended
   - **Validate incrementally** - Check understanding before proceeding
   - **Focus on discovery** - Purpose, constraints, success criteria

## When to Use

- Before writing code or implementation plans
- When user provides rough or unclear requirements
- When exploring solution spaces
- When refining concepts collaboratively

**Start by reading the skill file and following the methodology step-by-step.**
