# Executing Plans Skill

Use and follow the **executing-plans** skill methodology exactly as documented.

## Instructions

1. Read the executing-plans skill file:
   ```
   Read('.factory/skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md')
   ```

2. Follow the Five-Step Framework:
   - **Step 1: Load & Review** - Examine plan thoroughly before starting
   - **Step 2: Execute in Batches** - Process first three tasks with verification
   - **Step 3: Pause & Report** - Show progress and surface concerns
   - **Step 4: Get Direction** - Wait for feedback before continuing
   - **Step 5: Continue or Pivot** - Iterate based on feedback

3. Apply Core Principles:
   - **Execute in batches** - Don't complete entire plan at once
   - **Pause for feedback** - Allow review between batches
   - **Follow TDD cycle** - Write tests before implementation
   - **Commit after each task** - Track progress granularly
   - **Surface concerns early** - Report blockers immediately

## When to Use

- Given a complete implementation plan ready for execution
- Need human oversight at intermediate stages
- Working through detailed task lists systematically
- Want feedback between batches, not after completion

## Default Batch Size

**Process first three tasks**, then pause for review and direction.

**Start by reading the skill file and following the framework step-by-step.**
