# Writing Plans Skill

Use and follow the **writing-plans** skill methodology exactly as documented.

## Instructions

1. Read the writing-plans skill file:
   ```
   Read('.factory/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md')
   ```

2. Create a comprehensive plan with required sections:
   - **Goal**: One sentence - what we're building and why
   - **Architecture Overview**: How this fits into existing system
   - **Tech Stack**: All relevant technologies and frameworks
   - **Implementation Tasks**: Numbered atomic tasks (2-5 minutes each)
   - **Verification**: How to confirm each task succeeded

3. Apply Core Principles:
   - **Bite-sized tasks** - Each task 2-5 minutes
   - **Exact file paths** - No ambiguity about where code goes
   - **Complete code examples** - Don't assume codebase knowledge
   - **TDD approach** - Write tests before implementation
   - **Fresh eyes friendly** - Plan should work for unfamiliar developers

## When to Use

- Design is finalized and ready for implementation
- Need to break down complex features into steps
- Preparing work for delegation or parallel execution
- Creating specifications for developers unfamiliar with codebase

**Start by reading the skill file and following the plan structure exactly.**
